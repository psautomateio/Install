Start of psautomate fork of PGBlitz

I have test the installation of apps (plex,sonarr,radarr etc) and also the configuration of Rclone to use Teamdrives, these work correctly.
Other bits may have bugs though!

Not guaranteed to be without issues or bugs. I hope to improve on the whole ecosystem ASAP.

Start installation by running: curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psautomateio/Install/master/install.sh | sudo -H sh
