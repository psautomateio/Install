# PSAutomate.io

This is a fork of "plexguide"/"PGBlitz". The original author hasnt been seen or heard from in a few weeks so i have forked the project and started PSAutomate.

### Prerequisites

* A clean Ubuntu 18.04 Server - The original project did quote other Debian based OS's as working. But ias i havnt personally tested them, im going to say just Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is currently supported.
* A user with sudo rights. Please do not use `root`. You will have issues.


### Installing

Installation is simple. Its just a case of running the following script and following the instructions.

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psautomateio/Install/master/install.sh | sudo -H sh
```

I encourage you to take a look at the script and what its doing for your own peace-of-mind.
